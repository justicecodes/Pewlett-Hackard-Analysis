# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
module 7 challenge

After executing the code and checking the results, a few folks are are appearing twice. Maybe they moved departments? It's interesting how each list has given Bobby a question to ask his manager. So far, Bobby would like to know the following:

What's going on with the salaries, low salaries for veteran and older employees?
Why are there only five active managers for nine departments, where are d001 (Marketing), d002 (Finance), d005 (Development), d006 (Quality Management) ?
Why are some employees appearing twice in different departments?
