# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
module 7 challenge

Pewlett Hackard is offering retirement packages to employees that meet certain qualifications. However, the company has realized that a large number of their employees meet those standards and are anticipating having many openings in the next years. So, a HR analyst, Bobby, is performing employee research to find out who may be retiring and how many positions in different departments may need to be filled. During his analysis, Bobby ran into other questions that he will need to discuss with his manager and provide further research on the employee databases provided.  

## Results:
- P-H decided that a mentorship program offered to veteran employees born in 1965 and close to retirement could be beneficial to keeping those employees longer. There are 1,549 employees who have been working at the company more than 5 years (from date 1998 or before) that would qualify. 
  - However, all of these employees, drawn from the original employee information file given, were born between 1-1-65 and 2-1-65, no later in the year. Note there may be information missing from the employee database provided.

- Further analysis was done to show that most of these eligible mentors have the title of Senior Staff and a high number of Senior Engineers, showing they would be effective at helping employees in many introductory positions.

- In the analysis of all employees eligible for retirement, the top two positions leaving are Senior positions which could create trouble for management of the company if many retire soon.

- There are 72,458 employees total born before 1956 and currently employed that are eligible for retirement. This is out of 300,024 total employees. 24% of all employees are eligible for retirement. 

## Summary:


The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
After executing the code and checking the results, a few folks are are appearing twice. Maybe they moved departments? It's interesting how each list has given Bobby a question to ask his manager. So far, Bobby would like to know the following:

What's going on with the salaries, low salaries for veteran and older employees?
Why are there only five active managers for nine departments, where are d001 (Marketing), d002 (Finance), d005 (Development), d006 (Quality Management) ?
Why are some employees appearing twice in different departments?
